# readme-generator
This app allows a user to generate a detailed README.md file by being prompted from the command line via Node, using their basic information given and retrieved from Github. Having a detailed README gives developers a better understanding of how the app is created, how it is used, and other details that are pertinent for developers to contribute to the project.
